# Insights from vessels and Ports data
Vessels and port insights

Data is: 

- Vessels movements from 2011 to 2017 across all ports around the world 
- Each port characterestics 



Questions I tried to answer:

What ports have been visited most for all type of vessels size total in each year, month and season? 

What is the average sailing time per each route between the ports? Are they related to vessel type? How? 

In total which ports are better connected? Which route? And in future which ports will be better connected in which countries?  

What is the relation between visits and port characteristics? For example vessel size and depth of port? And how about waiting port time with, vessel size and port size? how they are related? Which variable(s) are most important one? 

What does the future movement look like? 

What are the total arrival and departure visit number for each port ? is the related to variables and vessel types? 

Hoe ports could be classified or clustered based on characteristics and visits? 

Which ports in future needs to expand to decrease the port times and make more smoother movement and which variables are more important?
